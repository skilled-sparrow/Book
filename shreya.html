                       <p> He was scrolling instagram like his usual days. But on 11th march 2020 he 
                           came across a story he could not resist replying. It was an art made by her.
                           And they Started talking about sketching. It was not untill 30th october that they 
                           started texting often. The day on which he first cracked a joke of sleeping together.
                           It was a brave move from his side and maybe that's why she wanted to see where this 
                           conversation goes. That was his chance to show her what he got and take it to the
                           next level.

                        <p> Did he fall on 11th March for her art? Or did he fall on 30th oct for her great
                            schedule of sleeping before 11P.M.? Maybe he fell for her when he saw her post 
                            with an infant, just raw and real, with no editing and no intention of hiding who
                            she really was. Who is like that on internet. Or maybe he fell for her when he saw 
                            her athleticism that she could climb a tree. He fell for her when he saw her body 
                            draped in a black dress. Probably he fell for her curves. Or did he fall for her 
                            unfiltered words, her superiority complex, her art of not giving a fuck, or her subtle
                            way of showing emotions, her rare appreciations. The answer of when did he fall is still
                            a mystery, maybe because he falls for her everyday.</p>

                        <p> From "Your wish, because I really couldn't care less", "Do not care", "And stopped
                            caring about stuff", "I do not care", "I don't really care", "But I still don't care"
                            to "I loved that compliment. I don't usually care about flattery, but you win this 
                            time", "Ha ha, not gonna lie, I am pretty impressed", "I am flattered", "I care", 
                            "I care a little but. *bit". If not long it was definitely a tough journey especially for
                            him. Does she care or not, a bit or more is still a mystery to be solved and as he
                            loves mystery thrillers he'll definitely take this trip, a trip of high uncertainity
                            but that's what he live for!

                           The final chapter it is. The end of a saga, or you can say end of the story.
                           Which it's definitely not. Even if he tries to leave or tries to end it, he 
                           falls back again in her DMs back to suqare one. If willfully he tries not
                           to come back she texts him, and you must know by now that he can not resist himself
                           from replying to her texts. Even if it's the end from her side, he'll ensure That
                           he starts it all over again and begin working on blockchain technology and impress
                           her with a webapp based on etherium which is secure and safe.
